# LLM_with_AMDGPU

Sharing what I have done about running LLM with AMD GPU. 
The AMD dGPU(Radeon GPU) and iGPU will be used first to show how to run LLM which you may easy to own. YES, I means they are more cheaper than NVIDIA GPU.

## Radeon GPU + ROCm
From PyTorch2.0, ROCm is be one part of it and out-of-box to use AMD dGPU(MIxxx and Radeon GPU) for AI/ML.
	

## AMD iGPU + vulkan
*to-do*

## AMD GPU + MLC-LLM
*to-do*
